fancybox v1.3.6 / ProcessWire
===========================================================================

<strong><a href="https://github.com/nvidoni/fancybox">DEMO</a></strong>

<strong>What's new compared to v1.3.4</strong>

1. mobile &amp; tablet support (iPhone, iPod, iPad, Android, BlackBerry)
2. CSS3 optimizations
3. iframe fix
4. dropped IE6-7 support for shadows &amp; opacity.

<strong>Usage</strong>

Check out the <a href="http://fancybox.net/api">API</a> at official site. There is a new option <strong>showIframeLoading</strong> (true/false; default:true) that shows loading indicator (spinner) while loading iframes.

You can use plugin as standalone, these optimizations are not tied to ProcessWire CMS (but are implemented for it).
